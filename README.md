🕐 TimeSync Tool - Synchronization Script for Penetration Testing
📋 Description
TimeSync Tool is a specialized Python utility designed to solve the "Clock Skew Too Great" error in Kerberos authentication during penetration testing and security assessments. This script automatically synchronizes your system time with target machines in Active Directory environments, enabling successful execution of Impacket tools and other time-sensitive security testing.

🎯 Key Features
Feature	Description
🔄 Automatic Time Sync	Synchronizes system clock with domain controllers and target machines
💾 Backup & Restore	Creates automatic backups of timezone and system time configuration
🎯 Multiple Sync Methods	Supports NTP synchronization and manual time setting
🔧 Kerberos Problem Solver	Specifically addresses KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW errors in Active Directory
📊 Progress Tracking	Visual progress bars using pwn library for better user experience
🛡️ Safety Features	Automatic NTP disabling to prevent time reversion
🚀 Use Cases
Penetration Testing: Resolve Kerberos time synchronization issues

Red Team Operations: Maintain proper time sync during AD attacks

Security Research: Test time-dependent vulnerabilities

Forensic Analysis: Coordinate timestamps across multiple systems

# Check backup status
sudo python3 time_sync.py --check-backup
🔧 Problem Solved
This tool specifically addresses the critical Kerberos error:

text
Kerberos SessionError: KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW(Clock skew too great)
By ensuring time synchronization within the 5-minute tolerance window required by Kerberos authentication protocols in Windows Active Directory environments.

📝 Requirements
Python 3.6+

Root/Administrator privileges

ntpdate system package

Network access to target time sources

🛡️ Safety Notes
Always creates backups before time modifications

Provides restoration functionality

Includes validation and confirmation prompts

Designed for authorized security testing only

This tool is essential for security professionals working with time-sensitive protocols in enterprise environments, particularly when conducting Active Directory security assessments and penetration testing.
